        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The elements, such as the meta and title elements, are nested inside the head element.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
         <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a (anchor) element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
        <li>We can use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>
