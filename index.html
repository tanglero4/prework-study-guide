        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The elements, such as the meta and title elements, are nested inside the head element.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
         <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a (anchor) element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
        <li>We can use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
<li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
<li>CSS determines the styles of a webpage in order to make a website visually appealing</li>
 <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
<li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
<li> The special wild card symbol, or * is used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
<li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. </li>
<li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
<li>In the preceding statement, a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
<li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
<li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
