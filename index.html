        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The elements, such as the meta and title elements, are nested inside the head element.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
         <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a (anchor) element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
        <li>We can use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
<li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
<li>CSS determines the styles of a webpage in order to make a website visually appealing</li>
 <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
<li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
<li> The special wild card symbol, or * is used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
<li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. </li>
<li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
<li>In the preceding statement, a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
<li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
<li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
        <li>The .js file extension indicates that this file is a JavaScript file.</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>One of its core features is variables, which store data types as values.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
        <li>we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
        <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
        <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
        <li>The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. </li>
        <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
        <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
        <li>The java script code goes in the bottom of the body.script src="./assets/script.js" /script</li>
        <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
        <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a file.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Ex: ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"]; and var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];</li>
        <li>The first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
        <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. Ex: /* */</li>
        <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform. </li>
        <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
